Project Brief: GenAI Chatbot

Objective

Inspired by companies like GitLab, which embody a ‚Äúbuild in public‚Äù philosophy, this project aims to foster transparency, collaboration, and learning. GitLab openly shares its strategies, roadmaps, and internal processes, encouraging community feedback and improvement.

The challenge for this project is to develop an interactive chatbot that allows users‚Äî the employees or aspiring employees‚Äîto easily access information from GitLab‚Äôs Handbook and Direction pages. By providing an engaging interface, the chatbot will retrieve relevant information based on user queries and help users learn in an accessible and engaging way.

Project Scope and Requirements

Deliverables
Project Documentation
A clear project write-up explaining your approach, decisions, and key technical choices made throughout the project.
GitHub Repository
Include all source code and files in a GitHub repository.
Ensure the repository has a README with detailed instructions for setting up and running the chatbot locally.
Chatbot Core Functionality
Data Processing: Retrieve and structure relevant data from GitLab‚Äôs Handbook and Direction pages.
Chatbot Implementation: Develop a Generative AI-based chatbot capable of understanding and answering user questions effectively.
Frontend/UI Development
Use technologies like Streamlit, Gradio, or React to create a user-friendly chat interface. Ensure that:
Responses are displayed clearly, allowing users to ask follow-up questions seamlessly.
Basic error handling is implemented for smooth user interaction.
The UI has a simple, intuitive layout for accessibility.
Public Deployment
Deploy the chatbot and provide a public URL for access. Recommended platforms include: Vercel, Hugging Face Spaces, or Streamlit Community Cloud
